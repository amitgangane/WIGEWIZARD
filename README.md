WageWizard ðŸ’¼âœ¨

Overview: 
WageWizard is a machine learning project designed to help fresh graduates and job seekers estimate their expected salary based on their education, experience, and role. 
It uses a robust end-to-end ML pipeline and a Random Forest Regressor to deliver accurate, personalized salary predictions in seconds.

This project demonstrates:
  A complete ML workflow (EDA, preprocessing, modeling, deployment)
  An interactive approach to salary benchmarking
  Practical insights for students and career services

Business Problem:
Graduates and early-career professionals often face:
  Unclear salary expectations
  Anxiety about the job market
  Lack of personalized guidance
  
WageWizard addresses this by providing:
  Realistic salary ranges based on real-world data
  Data-driven advice for profile improvement
  An interactive tool to support career decisions
